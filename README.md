### Git Pong
#### Each programmer adds a random quote

```Example:
Programmer 1 : “Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.” ― Dr. Seuss
Programmer 2 : “So many books, so little time.” ― Frank Zappa
```

Robin: Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
